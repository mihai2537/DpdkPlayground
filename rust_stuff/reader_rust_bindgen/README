Some attempts to run init_eal using the document generated by bindgen
Yet is not working.

Update: it is working

WARNING: i think the reason it is working is the following: i added the $(pkg-config --cflags libdpdk)
after the "--" from the following example.

So the binding.rs used is different from old.

It is only a suspicion.

bindgen /tmp/headers/2_3_0/vm_core.h\
    -o bindings.rs \
    --impl-debug true \
    --no-doc-comments \
    --whitelist-type rb_iseq_constant_body \
    --whitelist-type rb_iseq_location_struct \
    --whitelist-type rb_thread_struct \
    --whitelist-type rb_iseq_struct \
    --whitelist-type rb_control_frame_struct \
    --whitelist-type rb_thread_struct \
    --whitelist-type RString \
    --whitelist-type VALUE \
